**21.01.2016 3.5h** *Chose a project. Got more familiar with the
 assignment, Git and markdown. Created a repository and NetBeans-project*

**22.01.2016 2h** *Added a description and just generally looked at
 the requirements, played around with Git and thought about the project.*

**28.01.2016 4h** *Began programming, focusing on the logic of the game
 and a temporary textual ui. I also wrote a few JUnit tests.*

**29.01.2016 4h** *Drew a class diagram, improved on the program,
 generated a pit report and updated the project documentation.*

**05.02.2016 4h** *Wrote more tests (for Grid and Game) and created a
new pit report. Made some adjustments to the code. Drew a tad more
descriptive class diagram.*

**12.02.2016 7.5h** *(Completed the suggested short GUI builder tutorial).
 Started on the GUI (without using the GUI builder).
 Wrote JavaDoc descriptions for all classes and all methods in Tile.
 Followed the instructions and generated a Checkstyle report,
 corrected the errors and generated a new report (kind of defeating
 the purpose of the report),
 which I submitted to the documentation.
 Wrote tests for Game, created a new pit report.
 Read up on Swing so I can plan the structure of the GUI.
 Although still not done with studying, I added an ActionListener and
 have a really basic game.*

**16.02.2016 1h** *Submitted a new Checkstyle report, in full this time...
Wrote some code (game over/won --> new game). (It works, but I should
probably still do some research)*
