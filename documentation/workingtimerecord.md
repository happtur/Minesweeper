**21.01.2016 3.5h** *Chose a project. Got more familiar with the
 assignment, Git and markdown. Created a repository and NetBeans-project*

**22.01.2016 2h** *Added a description and just generally looked at
 the requirements, played around with Git and thought about the project.*

**28.01.2016 4h** *Began programming, focusing on the logic of the game
 and a temporary textual ui. I also wrote a few JUnit tests.*

**29.01.2016 4h** *Drew a class diagram, improved on the program,
 generated a pit report and updated the project documentation.*

**05.02.2016 4h** *Wrote more tests (for Grid and Game) and created a
new pit report. Made some adjustments to the code. Drew a tad more
descriptive class diagram.*

**12.02.2016 7.5h** *(Completed the suggested short GUI builder tutorial).
 Started on the GUI (without using the GUI builder).
 Wrote JavaDoc descriptions for all classes and all methods in Tile.
 Followed the instructions and generated a Checkstyle report,
 corrected the errors and generated a new report (kind of defeating
 the purpose of the report),
 which I submitted to the documentation.
 Wrote tests for Game, created a new pit report.
 Read up on Swing so I can plan the structure of the GUI.
 Although still not done with studying, I added an ActionListener and
 have a really basic game.*

**16.02.2016 2.5h** *Submitted a new Checkstyle report, in full this time...
Wrote some code (game over/won --> new game). (It works, but I should
probably still do some research). Made some changes in Game and wrote
 a few new tests. Submitted a new pit report.*

**18.02.2016 4h** *Read about Swing Components. Thought about
 the execution of different features. Created three sequence diagrams
 (they're relatively similar to each other, mostly because I haven't
 made all the required decisions yet, so I had to focus on the areas
 where most of the important decisions have been made).
 Wrote JavaDoc descriptions for methods in Game.*

**19.02.2016 4.5h** *New class, DisplayPanel. More JavaDoc. Some changes
 in the code in preparation for new features.
 Generated Checkstyle report after making the required changes (also
 checks JavaDoc), fixed the errors (mainly JavaDoc) and generated a new
 report. Submitted both.
 Refactoring plus a better solution for the buttongrid + listener*

**22.02.2016 3.5h** *Dialog with player ("new game?" when game is over
 "what size? + how many bombs?" when new game), refactoring and a
 JMenuBar without listeners. Made corrections to dialog and TurnListener.*

**24.02.2016 2.5h** *Implemented invisible flagging :P
 To be worked on. Made it visible. Added a listener to the
 "New game"-menubutton.*

**26.02.2016 1.5h** *JavaDoc. Checkstyle. Wrote and added instructions
 and hastily done description of the structure. Made the .jar-file, got
 files, not sure what original-.. does but what the heck, uploaded*

**04.03.2016 3.25h** *Added a suggestion in the GameChoicesDialog and
 other minor changes. Combined flag(x, y) with isFlagged(x, y).
 Removed the TextUI. Realized I'm an idiot for calling the 'bombs'
 __bombs__ when the game is called __minesweeper__. Added the
 InstructionsDialog, the text should really be read from a file, buut
 that's too time consuming. New JavaDoc, pit report and Checkstyle report.*
