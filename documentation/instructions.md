###Instructions

The purpose of the game is to turn (by left-clicking them) every tile in the grid except the
 ones that represent bombs. Every turned non-bomb tile displays the
 number of bombs adjacent to it. If you turn a bomb-tile the game
 is lost. To help not accidentally turn bombs, you can flag (by right-clicking) tiles
 which makes them impossible to turn. You can also unflag (also right-clicking) the flagged
 tiles.


To help you keep count of the undiscovered bombs a counter, that starts
 at the total amount of bombs and decreases when you turn a tile, is
 displayed in the top left corner.


When the game is over, either won or lost, you will be asked if you'd
 like to play a new game. If you choose to do this a new window will
 pop up prompting you to decide the size of the grid and the amount
 of bombs you'd like. This is done by sliding the arrow along the 
 scale.


If for some reason you want to start a new game at any other time you
 may also find the "New Game" button in the menu. As well as instructions
 in case you forgot how to play.

Good luck and enjoy! :)
